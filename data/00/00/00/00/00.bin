  |   Experience Toki Tori's Epic Puzzle Adventure on the go, for the       |
  |   first time ever!                                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore an enthralling forest island, learn magical songs and         |
  |   interact with the local wildlife to solve environmental puzzles.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Toki Tori 2+'s ingenious game design requires just two moves:         |
  |   whistle and stomp. It's super accessible, yet it builds up to         |
  |   incredible complexity later on.                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There's a ton to do, too. After puzzle-solving your way to five       |
  |   Ancient Frogs and saving the island from a strange pollution, you     |
  |   can still find 100s of golden wings, snap dozens of creature          |
  |   pictures and go Achievement hunting.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Toki Tori 2+ is better than ever on Nintendo Switch, with lots of     |
  |   gameplay tweaks and even some new secrets and puzzle solutions.       |
  |   Plus, you can now create checkpoints wherever you like, allowing      |
  |   for easy experimentation.                                             |
